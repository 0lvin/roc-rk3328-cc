* Rockchip specific extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile
  Storage Host Controller

The Synopsys designware mobile storage host controller is used to interface
a SoC with storage medium such as eMMC or SD/MMC cards. This file documents
differences between the core Synopsys dw mshc controller properties described
by synopsys-dw-mshc.txt and the properties used by the Rockchip specific
extensions to the Synopsys Designware Mobile Storage Host Controller.

Required Properties:

* compatible: should be
	- "rockchip,rk3188-sdmmc": for Rockchip RK3188 and following
    - "rockchip,rk3288-sdmmc": for Rockchip RK3288 and following

* num-slots: 
	The number of slave devices supported for this single controller,
    default 1.

* clock-frequency: 
	Stable clk freq for data transfer

* clock-freq-min-max:
    Host issue slave devices for timing supportted ranges from this clk gap

* supports-highspeed:
	Indicate if this controller support highspeed mode or not

* supports-emmc:
	Indicate this controller works as emmc

* supports-sd:
	Indicate this controller works as sd/mmc card

* supports-sdio:
	Indicate this controller works as sdio function(card)

* ignore-pm-notify:
	Indicate this controller will ignore pm notify

* keep-power-in-suspend:
	Indicate this controller should keep power in system suspend

* broken-cd:
	For SD/MMC card, detect card insert/remove with controller's register flag

* card-detect-delay:
	For SD/MMC card insert/remove debounce time

Example:

	rkdwmmc0@12200000 {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-dw-mshc";
		reg = <0x12200000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <0 75 0>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
	};
